SUMMARY STATISTICS

COMPUTING THE SCORES 

What should that mean? - 
do you want the highest score to be the most popular? 
or the one where people go to most.

-Popularity-> popularity doesn't mean the best, macdonald will be best then as more people are eating there 
-average rating- that is a problem because it might be the case, that less people are going there 
-Probability of your liking.

How to compute?
-Frequency
-average
-more complicated

Formula of zagat-
rating-{0,1,2,3}
3- special, 2- very good 
    score=round(mean(ratings)*10)

Breaking it down-

popular is very important
averages can be misleading-
    can adjust by summing.
    can adjust normalize user rating.
    may want to consider credibiliy of individual raters(history of ratings)

more data is better ... to a poing
    - average, count, distribution

TAKEAWAYS-    

• Non-personalized popularity statistics or
averages can be effective in the right application

 Need to understand relationship between average
and user need; correct average
• In many cases it can be best to show count,
average, and distribution together
• For ranking, one alternative to average is the
percentage who score above a threshold, show how many liked and how many hated
– Or below!
• Personalization would address many limitations!

APPROACHES- 

* Average rating/upvote proportion
    - of poeple who vote- do they like it?
    - doesnt show popularity

* Net of upvotes/ no of likes
    - shows popularity
    - net controversy- how much this thing is hated

* %>= 4 stars('positive')
    - works well, how much people like item
    -but sometimes, people who like a thing rate it lower and thing they don't like, they rate it very lower,
    but it decrease the average rating, and if great than 4 is good, it won't be considered sometimes

*Full distribution of data
    - could be complicated for the users to process.

important thing to know-
    GOAL OF DISPLAY- the purpose of prediction or showing preference to show users if they want to buy/read/view the item


Amazon tells everything- 
-how many people rated, 
-what's the average
-rating given by users

WE SHOULD NOT JUST RANK BY SCORES
REASONS-
    * If we have two little data(one or two 5 star ratings)
    *Score may be multivariate
    Doman o business considerations
    - items is sold
    -items is unfavored(community or business reasons)

RANKING CONSIDERATIONS

*Confidence- how confident are we that this item is good

*Risk Tolerance
    - high risk, high reward
    - conservative recommendation

*Domain/ business consideration
    -age
    -type of community or country


DAMPED MEANS- 

Problem- low confidence with few ratings
solution- assume that without edidence, everything is average
ratings are evidence of non-averageness- its good or bad

formula- k controls strength of evidence required
